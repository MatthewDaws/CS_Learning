Bits and pieces as I learn C#.

   - "Fibonacci" is an implementation of a brute-force Fibonacci number calculator, using large integers.
   - "bits" contains just small stand alone programmes to explore aspects of C#.
   - "Sync" is a simple synchronisation tool to keep local files and files on e.g. a USB stick in sync.  Some attempt to develop from an OOP perspective.
